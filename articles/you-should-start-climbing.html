                        src="../assets/start-climbing.jpg">
                </p>
                <p><em>It&rsquo;s beautiful September morning. Summer is slowly packing its bags leaving closet space
                        for golden autumn shades&hellip; At last it is not that hot, you think, as your mind starts
                        clearing the paths of ideas. &ldquo;Hm&hellip; I want to start climbing. Yes. Man, imagine me up
                        this cliff above the seashore, or somewhere in the mountains, on a great day like this one,
                        going up, cherishing the view, one with the nature&hellip; Just great. What a joy! Yeah&hellip;
                        There&rsquo;s this newly opened gym in Bigz, it looks really good, it does. I should go.</em>
                </p>
                <p><strong><em>But&hellip; Yeah&hellip; Maybe&hellip; Maybe, after all, I&hellip;&rdquo;</em></strong>
                </p>
                <p>NO! Don&rsquo;t say it.</p>
                <p>Yes, you can.</p>
                <p>Climbing is a full-body-and-mind activity that is inherent to everyone; the movement of climbing is
                    among basic human movements. Look at the children! Back when that was us, we climbed like Olympic
                    professionals onto everything within the candy or challenge reach. Now that we are older
                    longer-limbed adults, climbing seems unnecessary as we can just raise our arms most of the time, set
                    our feet or do a little jump, and just take what we need (a candy). So&hellip; Why wouldn&rsquo;t we
                    do the same on a surface more challenging than ground? Why wouldn&rsquo;t we hop back in to
                    child-like selves and enjoy this new playground? Why wouldn&rsquo;t we enhance our physical and
                    mental state, experience nature on a completely different level, opt for a joyful and rewarding
                    lifestyle?</p>
                <p><em>Because reasons.</em></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>&ldquo;I want to start climbing, but I don&rsquo;t have any equipment.&rdquo;</strong>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>You should start climbing. At first, you won&rsquo;t need anything except comfortable clothes (sure,
                    that high school shorts and torn t-shirt are perfect) and old pair of shoes that you&rsquo;re not
                    sorry to devastate. Converse All Star (&ldquo;starke&rdquo;) or similar flea-market copy is a
                    popular choice among newcomers and for a good reason &ndash; strong rubber sole will keep you on the
                    rock better than Air Max variants. Also, for a price of Pinokio pancakes, you can rent climbing
                    shoes in our gym &ndash; the choice is getting fancier every day.</p>
                <p>You will need chalk, too, the holy powder of friction, to keep your sweaty palms dry and,
                    consequently &ndash; you on the rock. No worries, we have it in the gym already and we&rsquo;ll be
                    happy to lend you some for your first ascents.</p>
                <p>When you get hooked, your very own climbing shoes should be the first thing on your shopping
                    list.&nbsp; More on that <u>here </u>(link za Jelenin tekst o penjaƒçicama ispod &ldquo;here&rdquo;).
                </p>
                <p>For your first outdoor rock trip, you will need plentiful of items you don&rsquo;t have: climbing
                    rope, 15 quickdraws, harness, belay device, chalk, climbing shoes, and victorious attitude. We have
                    it all, attitude included. Yours is only to contribute to it by giving your best and passing it on.
                </p>
                <ol start="2">
                    <li><strong>&ldquo;I want to start climbing, but it seems really hard.&rdquo;</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>You should start climbing &ndash; and yes, it <em>is</em> hard. Nevertheless, we have experienced and
                    helpful coaches who will be there during your first climbing steps and make them easier. Working
                    with coaches is highly recommended for beginners &ndash; you want to avoid both injuries and
                    adopting incorrect technique (strenuous to fix afterwards). Soon enough, you&rsquo;ll be more
                    skilled and agile on the rock asking yourself what took you so long to start in the first place.</p>
                <ol start="3">
                    <li><strong>&ldquo;I want to start climbing, but I&rsquo;m afraid of the heights.&rdquo;</strong>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Well, you should start climbing because you&rsquo;ll be in a great company &ndash; a lot of climbers
                    are afraid of the heights, or at least they used to be. Fear is a temporary illusion; it goes away
                    when we (gradually) expose ourselves to it. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s no amount of fear that
                    today&rsquo;s climbing equipment with its safety standards cannot endure.</p>
                <p>Secret sharing time: climbers usually don&rsquo;t look down, they&rsquo;re too busy looking around
                    themselves in a search of the next best foot/hand hold. üòä</p>
                <ol start="4">
                    <li><strong>&ldquo;I want to start climbing, but I am way too old.&rdquo;</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>You should start climbing because you are not old &ndash; you are mature. As such, you know your
                    body, your excuses, and your limits, so it is time to outsmart all of them. Being mature, you are
                    probably organised and you won&rsquo;t waste precious time on chit-chat and gossiping when
                    there&rsquo;s training to be done. You are experienced in adaptation, so you will never get angry
                    with the rock when you can&rsquo;t climb something &ndash; you will just change your strategy which
                    will lead to success. On top of all that, you are younger than you will ever be again.</p>
                <ol start="5">
                    <li><strong>&ldquo;I want to start climbing, but I don&rsquo;t know anyone there.&rdquo;</strong>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>You should start climbing - you will get to know us easily. Climbers are a vivid bunch of introverts
                    and extroverts with different lives and interests outside the rocks, but we are all polite, helpful,
                    and happy to meet you. Honestly.</p>
                <ol start="6">
                    <li><strong>&ldquo;I want to start climbing, but I am too heavy.&rdquo;</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>You should start climbing. You will learn how to move efficiently in regards to your weight and body
                    composition. No sugar-coating here - being a struggle with gravity, climbing is easier if
                    you&rsquo;re on a somewhat lighter side of the spectrum, HOWEVER, there are numerous examples of
                    bulkier folks&rsquo; bodies getting adjusted to the nature of the sport without climbers even
                    noticing it happen (euphemism for: &ldquo;they lost excess weight&rdquo;). Come climb and your body
                    will react enthusiastically. Good stuff: if you&rsquo;re heavier, prior to becoming lean and strong,
                    you will more naturally adopt proper climbing technique needed to complete your routes. This is an
                    excellent pay-off because that good technique stays with you later on - forever.</p>
                <ol start="7">
                    <li><strong>&ldquo;I want to start climbing, but I am too weak.&rdquo;</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>You should DEFINITELY start climbing. Weak beginners are rock-star beginners &ndash; they are
                    resourceful, they use their whole bodies to stay balanced, their movement patterns vary, their
                    impeccable footwork compensates for the lack of upper-body physique. Strength does matter (injury
                    prevention, confidence, additional movement variety) and in time, you <em>will</em> get stronger
                    surprising yourself with all those impossible moves becoming a warm-up route. Start climbing soon.
                    Power to the weak!</p>
                <ol start="8">
                    <li><strong>&ldquo;I want to start climbing, but I am too skinny.&rdquo;</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Ok, what? Get on the wall.</p>
                <ol start="9">
                    <li><strong>&ldquo;I want to start climbing, but I am way too strong for that.&rdquo;</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Nobody&rsquo;s pushing.</p>
                <ol start="10">
                    <li><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an extrovert, I enjoy team sports and climbing seems like a lonely
                            endeavour.&rdquo;</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Alone on the wall you are indeed. Nevertheless, climbers are exuberant in showing their support
                    during crucial times on a climb and sometimes you will feel like an entire stadium is cheering for
                    you to finish that route. Plus, pre-climb and post-climb talks will make your extroverted heart
                    pumping like a blast.</p>
                <ol start="11">
                    <li><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an introvert, I don&rsquo;t like to be looked at and cheered for while
                            climbing.&rdquo;</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>You are alone on that wall. Do your thing and don&rsquo;t worry about the eyes and shouts. Also,
                    pre-climb and post-climb talks with a chosen few will get your introverted heart pumping blissfully.
                </p>
                <p>You should start climbing. There won&rsquo;t be a candy waiting for you on the top anymore. Still,
                    time well spent, realisation of elusiveness of your limits, and kind people you&rsquo;ll meet on the
                    way should be enough to make up for it.</p>
